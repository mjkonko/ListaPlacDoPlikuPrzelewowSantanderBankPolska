Legacy converter bc Im too lazy to type the transfers by hand everytime and the input and output are always identical, only the amount changes (or there are more or less transfers).

I don't see any use for anyone unless they:
- receive the exact same format of pdfs with salary declarations for their company
- use a non-corporate account in Santander Bank Polska
- they want to look at some spaghetti code mess
